The Airline Management System is a robust desktop application aimed at optimizing the core operational processes of an airline. The system focuses on enhancing efficiency, maintaining data integrity, and providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. It has been developed using Core Java for implementing business logic, MySQL for secure and efficient database management, and Java Swing/Java AWT for designing a responsive graphical user interface (GUI). The application effectively addresses key airline functions, making it a reliable tool for managing airline operations.

1)𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:The primary objective of this system is to automate and simplify the various tasks involved in airline operations. It ensures real-time management of flight schedules, reservations, and passenger data, eliminating manual errors and improving overall productivity.

2)𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤:
1)Core Java: Implemented the business logic and functional workflows of the system.
2)MySQL: Provides robust, secure, and efficient data storage for flight details, passenger information, and booking records.
3)Java Swing/AWT: Designed an interactive and user-friendly interface for both passengers and administrators.

3)𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:

1. Flight Information Module:
   - Displays real-time flight schedules, routes, and availability.
   - Fetches data dynamically from the MySQL database for accuracy.

2. Ticket Booking System:
   - Allows users to book flight tickets by entering essential details like name, flight code, and travel date.
   - Automatically saves the reservation details into the database and assigns a unique PNR for tracking.

3. Journey Details:
   - Provides an overview of the user’s travel itinerary, including departure time, arrival time, and duration.
   - Data is retrieved and displayed in an organized format for user convenience.

4. Boarding Pass Generation:
   - Automates the process of generating boarding passes by fetching data using the passenger's PNR (Passenger Name Record).
   - Displays details such as passenger name, nationality, source, destination, flight code, and travel date.
   - Validates the PNR and shows error messages using `JOptionPane` if invalid.

5. Ticket Cancellation:
   - Securely handles ticket cancellations by removing relevant records from the database.
   - Updates seat availability in the system for real-time accuracy.

4)𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐬:

#Database Design:
  - Utilized MySQL to store and manage flight schedules, passenger details, reservations, and cancellations.
  - Ensured data integrity, security, and efficient query execution for real-time updates.

#User Interface:
  - The interface, designed with Java Swing and AWT, provides clear navigation and interactive elements for a seamless experience.
  - Features include dropdown menus, input fields, and dynamic data visualization.

#Error Handling and Validation:
  - Integrated robust error handling mechanisms to validate user input, such as PNR and flight codes.
  - Displays error messages and alerts using `JOptionPane`, improving user interaction and system reliability.

#Business Logic:
  - Core Java handles all backend operations, including database queries, logical computations, and UI interactions.
  - Utilized Java libraries to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness.


5)𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬:
    1. Efficiency: Automates manual processes like booking, boarding pass generation, and ticket cancellations.
    2. Accuracy: Real-time data retrieval ensures up-to-date flight and passenger information.
    3. Scalability: Modular design allows for easy extension of functionalities in the future.
    4. User-Friendly: A clean and intuitive interface ensures smooth operation for users of all technical backgrounds.
